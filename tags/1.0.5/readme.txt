Google Plus Comments  adds a tabbed Comment view with G+ Comment threads to your WordPress install while still ( optional ) keeping Native comments, plus can add in other comment systems as well.
This plugin lets you use the Google+ Comment System thats implented on blogger.com (unofficially) on your Wordpress.org blog.
Google+ makes commenting easier and more interactive, while connecting websites and commenters.
